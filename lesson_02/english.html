            <h2>A bit about me</h2>
            <p>My name is <mark>Anastasiia</mark>, I am 28 years old, and by profession — a <mark>chemist</mark>. I was born in a small village in the Odesa region, but since my university days, I have lived in Odesa, which I immensely enjoy for its unique charm and proximity to the sea. This city has become my home.</p>

        <div id="my-professional-path">
            <h2>My professional path</h2>
            <p>I worked for more than <mark>3 years</mark> in the pharmaceutical company <a href="https://interchem.ua/" target="_blank" title="Link to the page of the pharmaceutical company 'Interchem'">"Interchem"</a>. There, I was involved in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quality control of products</li>
                <li>Chemical compound analysis</li>
                <li>Participation in the development of new drugs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But in 2021, I went on <mark>maternity leave</mark>, and my life changed.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="finding-yourself">
            <h2>Finding Yourself in IT:</h2>
            <p>When I went on maternity leave, I became the mother of a wonderful girl and fully immersed myself in her upbringing. However, over time, I realized that working shifts and nights no longer suited my new lifestyle. This prompted me to seek remote work and reconsider my career plans.</p>
            <p>I began exploring various job directions, taking online tests to understand what truly interests me. All tests pointed to one thing — <mark>front-end development</mark>. After that, I started actively searching for information, looking for educational resources, and by chance, I came across the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreelancerLifeStyle" target="_blank" title="Link to YouTube channel 'Freelancer LifeStyle'">YouTube channel "Freelancer LifeStyle"</a>. The videos from this channel captivated me so much that I watched them all in a short time and became literally passionate about mastering this profession.</p>

        <div id="my-training">
            <h2>My steps in learning</h2>
            <p>Since then, my journey into <mark>front-end development</mark> began:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I completed several free lessons on YouTube.</li>
                <li>Finished front-end development courses.</li>
                <li>Comparing the training, I can say that the free lessons on YouTube were even more useful than the paid courses.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Unfortunately, the war has made adjustments to my life, and now my family and I are temporarily living in Ireland. My daughter has grown up, and I now have more time to achieve my professional goals.</p>
            <p>That’s why I am currently taking <a href="https://edu.fls.guru/" target="_blank" title="Link to the course on quality web interface development">this course</a> — I want to continue to develop and become a specialist in the field of <mark>front-end development</mark>.</p>
